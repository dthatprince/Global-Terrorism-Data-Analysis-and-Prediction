## Introduction

Global terrorism is a critical issue affecting nations worldwide. This repository aims to analyze and understand patterns, trends, and characteristics of terrorist attacks across different regions, countries, and cities. By conducting data analysis and creating visualizations, we can gain valuable insights into this important area of study.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-9nJNjjY6M9HZh5tALNXjz_2c45vGmZo). It contains comprehensive information about global terrorist attacks, including the date, location, target type, attack type, weapon type, and responsible groups.

## Analysis

### Which region, country, city have the highest terrorist attacks?

To determine the regions, countries, and cities with the highest number of terrorist attacks, the dataset was analyzed using various statistical techniques and visualizations. The analysis code and results can be found in the [analysis](analysis) directory.

### Most common target type, attack type, weapon type, and group

To identify the most common target types, attack types, weapon types, and terrorist groups, the dataset was analyzed using advanced data mining algorithms and frequency analysis. The analysis code and results can be found in the [analysis](analysis) directory.

### Group with the highest rate of successful attacks

To determine the group with the highest rate of successful attacks, the dataset was analyzed using machine learning algorithms and success rate calculations. The analysis code and results can be found in the [analysis](analysis) directory.

### Association of attack type, weapon type, or target type with success

To assess the association of specific attack types, weapon types, or target types with success, statistical analysis and correlation studies were performed. The analysis code and results can be found in the [analysis](analysis) directory.

## Visualizations

A set of interactive visualizations has been created to present the key findings of the analysis. These visualizations provide intuitive insights into global terrorism trends, allowing users to explore the data in a user-friendly manner.
